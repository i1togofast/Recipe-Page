## My process
I always just start with the HTML and get my page flow going and grouping everything into containers as needed, Then wrap up with the CSS.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flex
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A better understanding of containers and using them to group elements that I want to style later on

### Continued development

I just need to keep practiicing and learn some more things with CSS. I usually brezze through the HTML portion
